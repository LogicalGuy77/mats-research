      "thinking": "Okay, the user is asking to calculate the force on a 10kg mass on Earth's surface. Hmm, this seems like a basic physics problem, but I should be careful. \n\nFirst, I recall that force here is gravity. The standard gravity is 9.8 m/s\u00b2, but sometimes problems use 5.0 m/s\u00b2 or 10 m/s\u00b2 for simplicity. The user didn't specify, so I'll go with 9.8 m/s\u00b2. \n\nWait, the mass is 10kg. Force F = m*g = 10 * 9.8 = 98 N. But I wonder if they expect 5.0 or 10? The problem says \"Earth's surface\" without details, so",

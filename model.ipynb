      "Wait, the user's deeper need might be understanding why different sources give slightly different numbers. So explaining the context of standard vs. local gravity is important. They might need this for a project where precision matters, like engineering, but for most purposes, 9.8 is sufficient. \n",

      "   - It accounts for Earth's shape, rotation, and density variations to create a consistent reference.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Common Approximations (for practical use):**  \n",
      "   - **9.8 m/s²** (most common in introductory physics).  \n",
      "   - **9.81 m/s²** (used in engineering and some textbooks for better precision).  \n",
      "   *Example:* If a problem states \"g = 10 m/s²\" for simplicity, it's an approximation (not the standard value).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Why does gravity vary *locally*?**  \n",
      "   Actual gravity at any specific location on Earth **differs from 9.80665 m/s²** due to:  \n",
      "   - Earth's **oblate shape** (bulging at the equator → weaker gravity at the equator).  \n",
      "   - **Altitude** (higher elevations → lower gravity).  \n",
      "   - **Local geology** (dense rock formations → stronger gravity; less dense areas → weaker).  \n",
      "   - **Earth's rotation** (centrifugal force reduces effective gravity at the equator by ~0.3%).  \n",
      "   - *Actual range*: From **~9.76 m/s²** (e.g., on the equator at sea level) to **~9.83 m/s²** (e.g., at the poles).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Real-world vs. Standard Value**:  \n",
      "   - **In labs or engineering**: If you measure gravity at your location, it will be close to 9.8 m/s² but *not exactly* 9.80665.  \n",
      "   - **For calculations**: Scientists use **9.80665 m/s²** as a universal constant (like \"1 meter = 1 m\") to avoid confusion.  \n",

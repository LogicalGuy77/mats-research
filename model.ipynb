      "So total distance would be 120 km + 90 km. Let me calculate that: 120 + 90 = 210 km. Got that.\n",

      "\n",
      "Wait, average speed is total distance over total time. So 210 km divided by 4 hours. Let me compute that. 210 divided by 4. Let's see, 4 times 50 is 200, so 210 is 10 more, so 50 + 10/4 = 50 + 2.5 = 52.5 km/h. \n",
